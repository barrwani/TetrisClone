# Tetris Clone
A clone of tetris developed in a custom built SDL2 based game engine [(Barwani Engine)](https://github.com/barrwani/BarwaniEngine)  . 

Although tetris can be implemented without using any collision or ECS systems, this is more of a technical demonstration of the engine than it is the 'easiest possible' implementation of the game.
