# Tetris Clone
A clone of tetris developed in a custom built SDL2 based game engine [(Barwani Engine)](https://github.com/barrwani/BarwaniEngine)  . 

This is a slightly over the top implementation to tetris, where collision, sprite/asset management, and an entire ECS system aren't really necessary.

I guess consider it a way to show off the engine's capabilities...
